= Project: Numerical Simulation of a Cooling Device

== Overview

The aim of this project is to develop a C++ program to study the thermal
behavior of a microprocessor cooling device. One common method for regulating
the temperature of a processor is by using a fan. The airflow helps to
dissipate heat through convection on the processor's surface. To enhance this
process, the processor is typically attached to a heatsink
(composed of several fins), which is a highly heat-conductive element.
This additional device, increases the exchange surface with the airflow,
thus effectively cooling the electronic component.

== Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GiulioCrp/HeatFin.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd HeatFin
```

== Build the project

Configure and build the project using CMake:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build

# Build the project
cmake ..

# Compile the project
make

# Run the tests
make test
```

== Usage
```bash
cd build
./run
```

The results will be saved in the `/results` directory which is automatically 
created if needed.
